1)user input ipv4 address lets convert this into binary and represent it in 8bit_value.8bit_value.8bit_value.8bit_value
Sample Output :
IPv4 in Decimal = 192.168.1.1
IPv4 in Binary  = 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001

2)Satyam want to create network to connect 225 PC in Single
network lets write program to help him
-take user input below 254 as number of pc in network
and print IP address range,network address,brodcast address for same
Sample Output :
user input number below 254 = 128
Host Range = 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.126
network address :192.168.1.0
broadcast address :192.168.1.127
Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.128 i.e. /25 

3)Create menu driven program to display calendar
   Menu1 :  print specific month calendar according to user input month and year
   Menu2 :  print specific Year calendar
   Menu3 :  Exit
